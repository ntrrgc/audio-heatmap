Audio spectrum heatmap visualization
====================================

This little program continually generates a spectrum from a live audio source (like a microphone or the system audio monitor) and shows it as heapmap. The horizontal axis represents time, the vertical axis represents frequency (with a linear scale by default) and the color represents the amplitude of the harmonic with that frequency at that point of time.

A wave generator is useful to test how it works. Here is one that runs in the browser:

Chiptune songs are quite interesting to visualize, for instance.

How to build
------------

This application uses GStreamer, Clutter and GLib, so make sure to install development packages of these first. Also, the CMake build system is needed to build the project.

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./audio_heatmap
```

Technical parameters
--------------------

Sampling frequency: 8000 Hz (therefore the maximum readable frequency is 4000 Hz)
Number of bands: 600 (133.3 Hz each)
Spectrum interval: 10 ms
Minimum harmonic amplitude: -80 dB
Maximum harmonic amplitude: -20 dB

### Color coding

An intensity value between zero and one is generated by scaling the amplitude of the harmonic within its admitted range (-80 dB is zero, -20 dB). Optionally, the result is multiplied by a *gain* value that can be set to better visualize too loud or too quiet audio pieces.

A gradient is then used to color code the result:

* 0.0 is mapped to black (#000000).
* 0.2 is mapped to blue (#0000FF).
* 0.4 is mapped to cyan (#00FFFF).
* 0.6 is mapped to yellow (#FFFF00).
* 1.0 is mapped to white (#FFFFFF).
